# Coffee Champion

While developing my website, I thought it would be a nice addition to add some progress bars to demonstrate some of my skills visually. During my planning stage, I came across an idea to display the average cups of coffee per week. However, once I fully implemented the progress bar, I was not satisfied with a static number that never changes. I wanted to build something that will update my coffee consumption every time I drank a cup of coffee.  

## Objective: Build an Iphone application to track my coffee consumption  

## Skills Learned/Utilized:  
- Developed database layer utilizing TSQL to hold user information online  
- Built a RESTful API with ASP.NET Web API 2.0 and JSON -> Used by both IOS app and javascript AJAX  
- IOS app developed with SWIFT 2.0. -> Alomafire pod for HTTP networking  
- JQuery used for AJAX call for progress bar  
  
  
## What's to come:  
- Levels based on coffee count  
- Users will be given access codes which can then be used to implement their coffee consumption on their website  
- Dedicated website for coffee champion for users to get all required files for progress bar implementation -> AngularJS  
- Leader board  
- Launch IOS app on Apple Store
